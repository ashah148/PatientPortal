## 📚 Overview
The Patient Portal is a JavaFX-based GUI application designed to simulate a functional healthcare system interface. It includes features for patients, nurses, and doctors to manage appointments, vitals, communication, and prescriptions. The system ensures role-based access and form validation for user actions like account creation, login, medical data entry, and internal messaging.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔐 Role-based login for Patients, Doctors, and Nurses
- 🩺 Appointment scheduling and editing
- 💊 Medication tracking and prescription handling
- 📈 Vitals and questionnaire input by nurses
- 💬 Internal messaging between patients and staff
- 📋 Form validation and real-time error messages
- 👶 Conditional UI logic based on patient age (e.g., vitals form access)
- 🧪 Fully tested with over 30 system-level test cases

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java 17
- JavaFX (GUI Framework)
- Eclipse IDE
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Jira (project tracking and collaboration)

## 🧪 Testing
The application has been tested with 30+ use cases covering:
- User authentication and role-specific access
- Appointment creation/editing/deletion
- Validation errors for incorrect inputs
- Proper save behavior for vitals, messages, and prescriptions
- Edge cases such as empty forms, invalid data, and unauthorized actions
